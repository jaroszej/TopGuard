# TopGuard

TopGuard is a human-focused car safety monitoring and report system that uses computer vision and AI to enable rapid crash response.

[shown: TopGuard has detected a passenger's eyes have been closed for a prolonged period after an accident.]

## Concept  

Events that indicate passengers in a vehicle are injured or in danger are detected by TopGuard. Then, TopGuard can relay that information to the relevant services, such as police or medical units.
